# Cryptocurrency Exchange API Clients
## By Christian Murray

This repo contains a collection of python frontends for the public REST and Websocket (soon) of many popular crypto exchanges. 
Each contains methods for each endpoint. parameters are passed to the methods as arguments and the script handles everything else. 
Either a raw http response object or a dataframe can be returned. 
This requires json, pandas, and websocket to be installed via pip
Python3 only.
